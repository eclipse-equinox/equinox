 * Bundle groups represent a logical collection of plug-ins (aka bundles).
 * Bundle groups do not contain their constituents but rather collect them
 * together under a common label. The main role of a bundle group is to report
 * to the system (e.g., the About dialog) what bundles have been installed. They
 * are not intended for use in managing the set of bundles they represent.
 * <p>
 * Since the bulk of the branding related information is specific to the
 * consumer, bundle groups also carry an arbitrary set of properties. The valid
 * set of key-value pairs and their interpretation defined by the consumer in
 * the target environment.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Eclipse UI is the typical consumer of bundle groups and defines various
 * property keys that it will use, for example, to display About information.
 * See <code>org.eclipse.ui.branding.IBundleGroupConstants</code>.

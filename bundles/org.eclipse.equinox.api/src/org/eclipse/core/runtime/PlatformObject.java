 * An abstract superclass implementing the <code>IAdaptable</code> interface.

 * manager.

 * Note: In situations where it would be awkward to subclass this class, the
 * same effect can be achieved simply by implementing the {@link IAdaptable}
 * interface and explicitly forwarding the <code>getAdapter</code> request to an
 * implementation of the {@link IAdapterManager} service. The method would look
 * like:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     public &lt;T&gt; T getAdapter(Class&lt;T&gt; adapter) {
 *         IAdapterManager manager = ...;//lookup the IAdapterManager service         
 *         return manager.getAdapter(this, adapter);
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This class can be used without OSGi running.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clients may subclass.

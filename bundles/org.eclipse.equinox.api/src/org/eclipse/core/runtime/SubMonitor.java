/**
 * <p>
 * A progress monitor that uses a given amount of work ticks from a parent
 * monitor. This is intended as a safer, easier-to-use alternative to
 * SubProgressMonitor. The main benefits of SubMonitor over SubProgressMonitor
 * are:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>It is not necessary to call beginTask() or done() on an instance of
 * SubMonitor.</li>
 * <li>SubMonitor has a simpler syntax for creating nested monitors.</li>
 * <li>SubMonitor is more efficient for deep recursion chains.</li>
 * <li>SubMonitor has a setWorkRemaining method that allows the remaining space
 * on the monitor to be redistributed without reporting any work.</li>
 * <li>SubMonitor protects the caller from common progress reporting bugs in a
 * called method. For example, if a called method fails to call done() on the
 * given monitor or fails to consume all the ticks on the given monitor, the
 * parent will correct the problem after the method returns.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>USAGE:</b>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * When implementing a method that accepts an IProgressMonitor:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>At the start of your method, use <code>SubMonitor.convert(...).</code> to
 * convert the IProgressMonitor into a SubMonitor.</li>
 * <li>Use <code>SubMonitor.split(...)</code> whenever you need to call another
 * method that accepts an IProgressMonitor.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Example: Recommended usage</b>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This example demonstrates how the recommended usage of
 * <code>SubMonitor</code> makes it unnecessary to call IProgressMonitor.done()
 * in most situations.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is never necessary to call done() on a monitor obtained from
 * <code>convert</code> or <code>progress.split()</code>. In this example, there
 * is no guarantee that <code>monitor</code> is an instance of
 * <code>SubMonitor</code>, making it necessary to call
 * <code>monitor.done()</code>. The JavaDoc contract makes this the
 * responsibility of the caller.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *      // {@literal @}param monitor the progress monitor to use for reporting progress to the user. It is the caller's responsibility
 *      //        to call done() on the given monitor. Accepts <code>null</code>, indicating that no progress should be
 *      //        reported and that the operation cannot be cancelled.
 *      //
 *      void doSomething(IProgressMonitor monitor) {
 *          // Convert the given monitor into a progress instance 
 *          SubMonitor progress = SubMonitor.convert(monitor, 100);
 *              
 *          // Use 30% of the progress to do some work
 *          doSomeWork(progress.split(30));
 *          
 *          // Advance the monitor by another 30%
 *          progress.split(30);
 *          
 *          // Use the remaining 40% of the progress to do some more work
 *          doSomeWork(progress.split(40)); 
 *      }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Example: Branches</b>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This example demonstrates how to smoothly report progress in situations where
 * some of the work is optional.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * void doSomething(IProgressMonitor monitor) {
 * 	SubMonitor progress = SubMonitor.convert(monitor, 100);
 * 
 * 	if (condition) {
 * 		// Use 50% of the progress to do some work
 * 		doSomeWork(progress.split(50));
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	// Don't report any work, but ensure that we have 50 ticks remaining on the
 * 	// progress monitor.
 * 	// If we already consumed 50 ticks in the above branch, this is a no-op.
 * 	// Otherwise, the remaining
 * 	// space in the monitor is redistributed into 50 ticks.
 * 
 * 	progress.setWorkRemaining(50);
 * 
 * 	// Use the remainder of the progress monitor to do the rest of the work
 * 	doSomeWork(progress.split(50));
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Please beware of the following anti-pattern:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * if (condition) {
 * 	// Use 50% of the progress to do some work
 * 	doSomeWork(progress.split(50));
 * } else {
 * 	// Bad: Causes the progress monitor to appear to start at 50%, wasting half
 * 	// of the
 * 	// space in the monitor.
 * 	progress.worked(50);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Example: Loops</b>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This example demonstrates how to report progress in a loop.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * void doSomething(IProgressMonitor monitor, Collection someCollection) {
 * 	SubMonitor progress = SubMonitor.convert(monitor, 100);
 *
 * 	// Create a new progress monitor that uses 70% of the total progress and will
 * 	// allocate one tick
 * 	// for each element of the given collection.
 * 	SubMonitor loopProgress = progress.split(70).setWorkRemaining(someCollection.size());
 * 
 * 	for (Iterator iter = someCollection.iterator(); iter.hasNext();) {
 * 		Object next = iter.next();
 * 
 * 		doWorkOnElement(next, loopProgress.split(1));
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	// Use the remaining 30% of the progress monitor to do some work outside the
 * 	// loop
 * 	doSomeWork(progress.split(30));
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Example: Infinite progress</b>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This example demonstrates how to report logarithmic progress in situations
 * where the number of ticks cannot be easily computed in advance.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * void doSomething(IProgressMonitor monitor, LinkedListNode node) {
 * 	SubMonitor progress = SubMonitor.convert(monitor);
 * 
 * 	while (node != null) {
 * 		// Regardless of the amount of progress reported so far,
 * 		// use 0.01% of the space remaining in the monitor to process the next node.
 * 		progress.setWorkRemaining(10000);
 * 
 * 		doWorkOnElement(node, progress.split(1));
 * 
 * 		node = node.next;
 * 	}
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class can be used without OSGi running.
 * </p>

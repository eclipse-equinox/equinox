This package provides classes for
processing structured text.
<p>
There are various types of structured text. Each type should
be handled by a specific <i>type handler</i>. A number of standard
type handlers are supplied in the associated package
<a href="internal/consumable/package-summary.html">
org.eclipse.equinox.bidi.internal.consumable</a>.

<h2>Introduction to Structured Text</h2>
<p>
Bidirectional text offers interesting challenges to presentation systems.
For plain text, the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm
(<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">UBA</a>)
generally specifies satisfactorily how to reorder bidirectional text for
display. This algorithm is implemented in Java's presentation system.
</p><p>
However, all bidirectional text is not necessarily plain text. There
are also instances of text structured to follow a given syntax, which
should be reflected in the display order. The general algorithm, which
has no awareness of these special cases, often gives incorrect results
when displaying such structured text.
</p><p>
The general idea in handling structured text in this package is to add
directional formatting characters at proper locations in the text to
supplement the standard algorithm, so that the final result is correctly
displayed using the UBA.
</p><p>
A class which handles structured text is thus essentially a
transformation engine which receives text without directional formatting
characters as input and produces as output the same text with added
directional formatting characters, hopefully in the minimum quantity
which is sufficient to ensure correct display, considering the type of
structured text involved.
</p><p>
In this package, text without directional formatting characters is
called <b><i>lean</i></b> text while the text with added directional
formatting characters is called <b><i>full</i></b> text.
</p><p>
The class {@link
<a href="STextProcessor.html"><b>STextProcessor</b></a>}
is the main tool for processing structured text.  It facilitates
handling several types of structured text, each type being handled
by a specific
{@link <a href="custom/STextTypeHandler.html">
<b><i>type handler</i></b></a>} :</p>
<ul>
  <li>property (name=value)</li>
  <li>compound name (xxx_yy_zzzz)</li>
  <li>comma delimited list</li>
  <li>system(user)</li>
  <li>directory and file path</li>
  <li>e-mail address</li>
  <li>URL</li>
  <li>regular expression</li>
  <li>Xpath</li>
  <li>Java code</li>
  <li>SQL statements</li>
  <li>RTL arithmetic expressions</li>
</ul>
<p>
For each of these types, an identifier is defined in
{@link <a href="STextTypeHandlerFactory.html">
<b><i>STextTypeHandlerFactory</i></b></a>} :</p>
These identifiers can be used as argument in some methods of
<b>STextProcessor</b> to specify the type of handler to apply.
</p><p>
Another class in this package may be used to
complement the action of
{@link <a href="STextProcessor.html">STextProcessor</a>}:
<ul>
  <li>{@link <a href="STextStringRecord.html">STextStringRecord</a>}
      allows to record strings which are structured text with the
      type of the appropriate handler,
      so that another module can check if a given string has been recorded
      as a structured text string and run its type handler.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The classes included in this package are intended for users who
need to process structured text in the most straightforward
manner, when the following conditions are satisfied:
<ul>
  <li>There exists an appropriate handler for the type of the
      structured text.</li>
  <li>There is no need to specify non-default conditions related
      to the {@link <a href="advanced/STextEnvironment.html">
      environment</a>}.</li>
  <li>The only operations needed are to transform <i>lean</i> text
      into <i>full</i> text or vice versa.</li>
  <li>There is no interdependence between the processing of a
      given string and the processing of preceding or
      succeeding strings.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When their needs go beyond the conditions above,
users can use classes in the
{@link <a href="advanced/package-summary.html">
org.eclipse.equinox.bidi.advanced</a>} package:
<ul>
  <li>{@link <a href="advanced/ISTextExpert.html">ISTextExpert</a>}
      provides more sophisticated methods for processing the
      structured text.</li>
  <li>{@link <a href="advanced/STextEnvironment.html">STextEnvironment</a>}
      specifies properties of the environment.</li>
  <li>{@link <a href="advanced/STextExpertFactory.html">STextExpertFactory</a>}
      associates a type handler with an environment and provides
      a <code>STextExpert</code> instance for the user.
</ul>
<p>
Developers who want to develop new handlers to support types of
structured text not currently supported can use the following components
of the package {@link <a href="custom/package-summary.html">
org.eclipse.equinox.bidi.custom</a>}:
<ul>
  <li>{@link <a href="custom/STextTypeHandler.html">STextTypeHandler</a>}
      is a generic handler to be used as superclass for specific
      handlers.</li>
  <li>{@link <a href="custom/STextCharTypes.html">STextCharTypes</a>}
      provides services related to the bidi classification of characters.</li>
  <li>{@link <a href="custom/STextOffsets.html">STextOffsets</a>}
      provides services related to managing an array of offsets to locations
      where directional formatting characters should be added in the source
      string.</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are two other packages associated with the current one:
<ul>
  <li>{@link <a href="internal/package-summary.html">
      org.eclipse.equinox.bidi.internal</a>}</li>
  <li>{@link <a href="internal/consumable/package-summary.html">
       org.eclipse.equinox.bidi.internal.consumable</a>}</li>
</ul>
The tools in the first package can serve as example of how to develop
processors for currently unsupported types of structured text.<br>
The latter package contains classes for the processors implementing
the currently supported types of structured text.
<p>
However, users wishing to process the currently supported types of
structured text typically don't need to interact with these
two packages.

<h2>Known Limitations</h2>

<p>The proposed solution is making extensive usage of LRM, RLM, LRE, RLE
and PDF directional controls which are invisible but affect the way bidi
text is displayed. The following related key points merit special
attention:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implementations of the UBA on various platforms (e.g., Windows and
Linux) are very similar but nevertheless have known differences. Those
differences are minor and will not have a visible effect in most cases.
However there might be cases in which the same bidi text on two
platforms might look different. These differences will surface in Java
applications when they use the platform visual components for their UI
(e.g., AWT, SWT).</li>

<li>It is assumed that the presentation engine supports LRE, RLE and
PDF directional formatting characters.</li>

<li>Because some presentation engines are not strictly conformant to the
UBA, the implementation of structured text in this package adds LRM
or RLM characters in association with LRE, RLE or PDF in cases where
this would not be needed if the presentation engine was fully conformant
to the UBA. Such added marks will not have harmful effects on
conformant presentation engines and will help less conformant engines to
achieve the desired presentation.</li>
</ul>

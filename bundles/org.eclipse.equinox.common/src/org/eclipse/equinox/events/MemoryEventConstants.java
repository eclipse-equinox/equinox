package org.eclipse.equinox.events;

/**
 * Defines constants for memory event handlers. A memory event handler
 * implements the <code>org.osgi.service.event.EventHandler</code> interface as
 * specified by the OSGi Event Admin Service Specification.
 * <p>
 * For example, the following handler is registered to handle critical memory
 * events:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * BundleContext context = getContext();
 * EventHandler handler = getHandler();
 * Hashtable ht = new Hashtable();
 * ht.put(EventConstants.EVENT_TOPIC, MemoryEventConstants.TOPIC_CRITICAL);
 * context.registerService(EventHandler.class.getName(), handler, ht);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * There is no policy implemented for sending memory events in Equinox or
 * Eclipse by default. Another bundle must implement the policy that determines
 * when to send memory events. This policy must use the Event Admin Service to
 * fire memory events to the registered handlers.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @since 3.6

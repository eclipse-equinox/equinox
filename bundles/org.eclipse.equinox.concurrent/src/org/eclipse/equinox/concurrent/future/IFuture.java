/**
 * <p>
 * A future represents the future outcome of some operation(s).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The expected usage of a future is as a return value from some operation that
 * is to be executed asynchronously and then return some result.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * So, for example, a simple usage of an IFuture would be:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * IFuture future = foo();
 * ...
 * Object result = future.get();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Clients generally will hold onto the future for some amount of time, and then
 * call {@link #get()} or {@link #get(long)} to retrieve the result of the
 * operation. They may also call {@link #hasValue()} to determine whether any
 * values have been provided to the future (if <code>true</code>, meaning that
 * subsequent calls to {@link #get()} will not block), or {@link #isDone()} to
 * determine if <b>all</b> operations and results have been completed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If {@link #hasValue()} is true, then the client may access status information
 * associated with the completed operation(s) via {@link #getStatus()}. Until
 * {@link #hasValue()} is <code>true</code>, {@link #getStatus()} will be
 * <code>null</code>.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @see IStatus
 * @param <ResultType> the type that will be returned by {@link #get()} and/or
 *                     {@link #get(long)}
 * @since 1.1

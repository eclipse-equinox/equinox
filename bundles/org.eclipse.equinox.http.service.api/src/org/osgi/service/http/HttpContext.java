 * Context for HTTP Requests.

 * This service defines methods that the Http Service may call to get

 * <p>
 * Servlets may be associated with an {@code HttpContext} service. Servlets that
 * are associated using the same {@code HttpContext} object will share the same
 * {@code ServletContext} object.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If no {@code HttpContext} service is associated, a default
 * {@code HttpContext} is used. The behavior of the methods on the default
 * {@code HttpContext} is defined as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code getMimeType} - Does not define any customized MIME types for the
 * {@code Content-Type} header in the response, and always returns {@code null}.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@code handleSecurity} - Performs implementation-defined authentication
 * on the request.</li>
 * <li>{@code getResource} - Assumes the named resource is in the bundle of the
 * servlet service. This method calls the servlet bundle's
 * {@code Bundle.getResource} method, and returns the appropriate URL to access
 * the resource. On a Java runtime environment that supports permissions, the
 * Http Service needs to be granted
 * {@code org.osgi.framework.AdminPermission[*,RESOURCE]}.</li>

	 * The Http Service calls this method prior to servicing the specified
	 * request. This method controls whether the request is processed in the
	 * normal manner or an error is returned.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * If the request requires authentication and the Authorization header in
	 * the request is missing or not acceptable, then this method should set the
	 * WWW-Authenticate header in the response object, set the status in the
	 * response object to Unauthorized(401) and return {@code false}. See also
	 * RFC 2617: <i>HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication
	 * </i> (available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt).
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * If the request requires a secure connection and the {@code getScheme}
	 * method in the request does not return 'https' or some other acceptable
	 * secure protocol, then this method should set the status in the response
	 * object to Forbidden(403) and return {@code false}.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * When this method returns {@code false}, the Http Service will send the
	 * response back to the client, thereby completing the request. When this
	 * method returns {@code true}, the Http Service will proceed with servicing
	 * the request.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * If the specified request has been authenticated, this method must set the
	 * {@link #AUTHENTICATION_TYPE} request attribute to the type of
	 * authentication used, and the {@link #REMOTE_USER} request attribute to
	 * the remote user (request attributes are set using the
	 * {@code setAttribute} method on the request). If this method does not
	 * perform any authentication, it must not set these attributes.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * If the authenticated user is also authorized to access certain resources,
	 * this method must set the {@link #AUTHORIZATION} request attribute to the
	 * {@code Authorization} object obtained from the
	 * {@code org.osgi.service.useradmin.UserAdmin} service.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The servlet responsible for servicing the specified request determines
	 * the authentication type and remote user by calling the
	 * {@code getAuthType} and {@code getRemoteUser} methods, respectively, on
	 * the request.
	 * 
	 * @param request The HTTP request.
	 * @param response The HTTP response.
	 * @return {@code true} if the request should be serviced, {@code false} if
	 *         the request should not be serviced and Http Service will send the
	 *         response back to the client.
	 * @throws java.io.IOException may be thrown by this method. If this occurs,
	 *         the Http Service will terminate the request and close the socket.

 * are two types of customizations that are allowed.
 * <ol>
 * <li>Control the default selection filter used when no
 * &quot;osgi.http.whiteboard.context.select&quot; is specified.</li>
 * <li>Provide a prefix to the context path
 * &quot;osgi.http.whiteboard.context.path&quot; specified by
 * ServletContextHelper registrations.</li>

 * Registering a customizer results in re-initializing all existing
 * ServletContextHelper registrations. This should not be done often. Only the
 * highest ranked customizer is used the runtime.

 * It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback from
 * pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this SPI
 * will almost certainly be broken (repeatedly) as the SPI evolves.

/**
 * This interface encapsulates an authorization context on which bundles can
 * base authorization decisions where appropriate.
 * <p>
 * Bundles associate the privilege to access restricted resources or operations
 * with roles. Before granting access to a restricted resource or operation, a
 * bundle will check if the Authorization object passed to it possesses the
 * required role, by calling its hasRole method.
 * <p>
 * Authorization contexts are instantiated by calling
 * {@link UserAdmin#getAuthorization}
 * <p>
 * <font size="+1">Trusting Authorization objects.</font>
 * <p>
 * There are no restrictions regarding the creation of Authorization objects.
 * Hence, a service must only accept Authorization objects from bundles that has
 * been authorized to use the service using code based (or Java 2) permissions.
 * <p>
 * In some cases it is useful to use ServicePermissions to do the code based
 * access control. A service basing user access control on Authorization objects
 * passed to it, will then require that a calling bundle has the
 * ServicePermission to get the service in question. This is the most convenient
 * way. The framework will do the code based permission check when the calling
 * bundle attempts to get the service from the service registry.
 * <p>
 * Example: A servlet using a service on a user's behalf. The bundle with the
 * servlet must be given the ServicePermission to get the Service.
 * <p>
 * However, in some cases the code based permission checks need to be more
 * fine-grained. A service might allow all bundles to get it, but require
 * certain code based permissions for some of its methods.
 * <p>
 * Example: A servlet using a service on a user's behalf, where some service
 * functionality is open to anyone, and some is restricted by code based
 * permissions. When a restricted method is called (e.g., one handing over an
 * Authorization object), the service explicitly checks that the calling bundle
 * has permission to make the call.

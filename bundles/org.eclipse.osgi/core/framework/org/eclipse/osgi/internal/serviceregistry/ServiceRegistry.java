	 * Registers the specified service object with the specified properties

	 * Other bundles can locate the service by using either the
	 * {@link #getServiceReferences} or {@link #getServiceReference} method.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * A bundle can register a service object that implements the
	 * {@link ServiceFactory} interface to have more flexibility in providing
	 * service objects to other bundles.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The following steps are required to register a service:

	 * an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> is thrown if
	 * <code>service</code> is not an <code>instanceof</code> all the
	 * classes named.

	 * <code>Dictionary</code> (which may be <code>null</code>): a property
	 * named {@link Constants#SERVICE_ID} identifying the registration number of
	 * the service and a property named {@link Constants#OBJECTCLASS} containing
	 * all the specified classes. If any of these properties have already been
	 * specified by the registering bundle, their values will be overwritten by
	 * the Framework.
	 * <li>The service is added to the Framework service registry and may now
	 * be used by other bundles.
	 * <li>A service event of type {@link ServiceEvent#REGISTERED} is fired.
	 * <li>A <code>ServiceRegistration</code> object for this registration is
	 * returned.

	 *        The class names in this array will be stored in the service's
	 *        properties under the key {@link Constants#OBJECTCLASS}.
	 * @param service The service object or a <code>ServiceFactory</code>
	 *        object.
	 * @param properties The properties for this service. The keys in the
	 *        properties object must all be <code>String</code> objects. See
	 *        {@link Constants} for a list of standard service property keys.
	 *        Changes should not be made to this object after calling this
	 *        method. To update the service's properties the
	 *        {@link ServiceRegistration#setProperties} method must be called.
	 *        The set of properties may be <code>null</code> if the service
	 *        has no properties.

	 * considered to satisfy the filter.

	 * <code>ServiceReferenceImpl</code> objects produced by the previous step is
	 * reduced by checking that the caller has the
	 * <code>ServicePermission</code> to get at least one of the class names
	 * under which the service was registered. If the caller does not have the
	 * correct permission for a particular <code>ServiceReferenceImpl</code>
	 * object, then it is removed from the set.
	 * <li>If <code>clazz</code> is not <code>null</code>, the set is
	 * further reduced to those services that are an <code>instanceof</code>
	 * and were registered under the specified class. The complete list of
	 * classes of which a service is an instance and which were specified when
	 * the service was registered is available from the service's
	 * {@link Constants#OBJECTCLASS} property.
	 * <li>The set is reduced one final time by cycling through each
	 * <code>ServiceReference</code> object and calling
	 * {@link ServiceReference#isAssignableTo(Bundle, String)} with the context
	 * bundle and each class name under which the <code>ServiceReference</code>
	 * object was registered. For any given <code>ServiceReferenceImpl</code>

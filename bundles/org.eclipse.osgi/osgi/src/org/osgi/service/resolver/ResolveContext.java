 * <li>Specify the mandatory and optional resources to resolve. The mandatory
 * and optional resources must be consistent and correct. For example, they must
 * not violate the singleton policy of the implementer.</li>
 * <li>Provide {@link Capability capabilities} that the Resolver can use to
 * satisfy {@link Requirement requirements} via the
 * {@link #findProviders(Requirement)} method</li>
 * <li>Constrain solutions via the {@link #getWirings()} method. A wiring
 * consists of a map of existing {@link Resource resources} to {@link Wiring
 * wiring}.</li>
 * <li>Filter requirements that are part of a resolve operation via the
 * {@link #isEffective(Requirement)}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A resolver may call the methods on the resolve context any number of times

 * Except for {@link #insertHostedCapability(List, HostedCapability)} and
 * {@link #onCancel(Runnable)}, the resolve context methods must be
 * <i>idempotent</i>. This means that resources must have constant capabilities
 * and requirements and the resolve context must return a consistent set of

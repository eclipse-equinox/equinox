/**
 * This class is the central class for the Event Manager. Each
 * program that wishes to use the Event Manager should construct
 * an EventManager object and use that object to construct
 * ListenerQueue for dispatching events. CopyOnWriteIdentityMap objects
 * must be used to manage listener lists.
 *
 * <p>This example uses the fictitious SomeEvent class and shows how to use this package
 * to deliver a SomeEvent to a set of SomeEventListeners.
 * <pre>
 *
 * 	// Create an EventManager with a name for an asynchronous event dispatch thread
 * 	EventManager eventManager = new EventManager("SomeEvent Async Event Dispatcher Thread");
 * 	// Create a CopyOnWriteIdentityMap to hold the list of SomeEventListeners
 *	Map eventListeners = new CopyOnWriteIdentityMap();
 *
 *	// Add a SomeEventListener to the listener list
 *	eventListeners.put(someEventListener, null);
 *
 *	// Asynchronously deliver a SomeEvent to registered SomeEventListeners
 *	// Create the listener queue for this event delivery
 *	ListenerQueue listenerQueue = new ListenerQueue(eventManager);
 *	// Add the listeners to the queue and associate them with the event dispatcher
 *	listenerQueue.queueListeners(eventListeners.entrySet(), new EventDispatcher() {
 *		public void dispatchEvent(Object eventListener, Object listenerObject,
 *                                    int eventAction, Object eventObject) {
 * 			try {
 *				(SomeEventListener)eventListener.someEventOccured((SomeEvent)eventObject);
 * 			} catch (Throwable t) {
 * 				// properly log/handle any Throwable thrown by the listener
 * 			}
 *		}
 *	});
 *	// Deliver the event to the listeners.
 *	listenerQueue.dispatchEventAsynchronous(0, new SomeEvent());
 *
 *	// Remove the listener from the listener list
 *	eventListeners.remove(someEventListener);
 *
 *	// Close EventManager to clean when done to terminate async event dispatch thread.
 *	// Note that closing the event manager while asynchronously delivering events
 *	// may cause some events to not be delivered before the async event dispatch
 *	// thread terminates
 *	eventManager.close();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>At first glance, this package may seem more complicated than necessary
 * but it has support for some important features. The listener list supports
 * companion objects for each listener object. This is used by the OSGi framework
 * to create wrapper objects for a listener which are passed to the event dispatcher.
 * The ListenerQueue class is used to build a snap shot of the listeners prior to beginning
 * event dispatch.
 *
 * The OSGi framework uses a 2 level listener list for each listener type (4 types).
 * Level one is managed per framework instance and contains the list of BundleContexts which have
 * registered a listener. Level 2 is managed per BundleContext for the listeners in that
 * context. This allows all the listeners of a bundle to be easily and atomically removed from
 * the level one list. To use a "flat" list for all bundles would require the list to know which
 * bundle registered a listener object so that the list could be traversed when stopping a bundle
 * to remove all the bundle's listeners.
 *
 * When an event is fired, a snapshot list (ListenerQueue) must be made of the current listeners before delivery
 * is attempted. The snapshot list is necessary to allow the listener list to be modified while the
 * event is being delivered to the snapshot list. The memory cost of the snapshot list is
 * low since the ListenerQueue object uses the copy-on-write semantics
 * of the CopyOnWriteIdentityMap. This guarantees the snapshot list is never modified once created.
 *
 * The OSGi framework also uses a 2 level dispatch technique (EventDispatcher).
 * Level one dispatch is used by the framework to add the level 2 listener list of each
 * BundleContext to the snapshot in preparation for delivery of the event.
 * Level 2 dispatch is used as the final event deliverer and must cast the listener
 * and event objects to the proper type before calling the listener. Level 2 dispatch
 * will cancel delivery of an event
 * to a bundle that has stopped between the time the snapshot was created and the
 * attempt was made to deliver the event.
 *
 * <p> The highly dynamic nature of the OSGi framework had necessitated these features for
 * proper and efficient event delivery.
 * @since 3.1
 * @noextend This class is not intended to be subclassed by clients.

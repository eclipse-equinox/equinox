/**
 * The ListenerQueue is used to snapshot the list of listeners at the time the event
 * is fired. The snapshot list is then used to dispatch
 * events to those listeners. A ListenerQueue object is associated with a
 * specific EventManager object. ListenerQueue objects constructed with the same
 * EventManager object will get in-order delivery of events when
 * using asynchronous delivery. No delivery order is guaranteed for synchronous
 * delivery to avoid any potential deadly embraces.
 *
 * <p>ListenerQueue objects are created as necessary to build a list of listeners
 * that should receive a specific event or events. Once the list is created, the event
 * can then be synchronously or asynchronously delivered to the list of
 * listeners. After the event has been dispatched for delivery, the
 * ListenerQueue object should be discarded as it is likely the list of listeners is stale.
 * A new ListenerQueue object should be created when it is time to deliver
 * another event. The Sets used to build the list of listeners must not change after being
 * added to the list.

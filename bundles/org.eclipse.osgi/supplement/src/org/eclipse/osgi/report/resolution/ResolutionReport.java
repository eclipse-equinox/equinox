/**
 * A resolution report is associated with a single resolve process. Entries
 * contained in a resolution report will contain entries for all resources that
 * were attempted to be resolved in a single resolve process. Resolution reports
 * are gathered by a special type of {@link ResolverHook} which implements the
 * report {@link Listener} interface. The following example demonstrates how to
 * gather a resolution report for a list of bundles
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 
 * public static ResolutionReport getResolutionReport(Bundle[] bundles, BundleContext context) {
 * 	DiagReportListener reportListener = new DiagReportListener(bundles);
 * 	ServiceRegistration&lt;ResolverHookFactory&gt; hookReg = context.registerService(ResolverHookFactory.class,
 * 			reportListener, null);
 * 	try {
 * 		Bundle systemBundle = context.getBundle(Constants.SYSTEM_BUNDLE_LOCATION);
 * 		FrameworkWiring frameworkWiring = systemBundle.adapt(FrameworkWiring.class);
 * 		frameworkWiring.resolveBundles(Arrays.asList(bundles));
 * 		return reportListener.getReport();
 * 	} finally {
 * 		hookReg.unregister();
 * 	}
 * }
 * 
 * private static class DiagReportListener implements ResolverHookFactory {
 * 	private final Collection&lt;BundleRevision&gt; targetTriggers = new ArrayList&lt;BundleRevision&gt;();
 * 	volatile ResolutionReport report = null;
 * 
 * 	public DiagReportListener(Bundle[] bundles) {
 * 		for (Bundle bundle : bundles) {
 * 			BundleRevision revision = bundle.adapt(BundleRevision.class);
 * 			if (revision != null &amp;&amp; revision.getWiring() == null) {
 * 				targetTriggers.add(revision);
 * 			}
 * 		}
 * 
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	class DiagResolverHook implements ResolverHook, ResolutionReport.Listener {
 * 
 * 		public void handleResolutionReport(ResolutionReport report) {
 * 			DiagReportListener.this.report = report;
 * 		}
 * 
 * 		public void filterResolvable(Collection&lt;BundleRevision&gt; candidates) {
 * 		}
 * 
 * 		public void filterSingletonCollisions(BundleCapability singleton,
 * 				Collection&lt;BundleCapability&gt; collisionCandidates) {
 * 		}
 * 
 * 		public void filterMatches(BundleRequirement requirement, Collection&lt;BundleCapability&gt; candidates) {
 * 		}
 * 
 * 		public void end() {
 * 		}
 * 
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	public ResolverHook begin(Collection&lt;BundleRevision&gt; triggers) {
 * 		if (triggers.containsAll(targetTriggers)) {
 * 			// this is the triggers we are looking for
 * 			return new DiagResolverHook();
 * 		}
 * 		// did not find the expected triggers do not participate
 * 		// in the resolve process to gather the report
 * 		return null;
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	ResolutionReport getReport() {
 * 		return report;
